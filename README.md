# Project 12: Fun with Strings

You are to create a two class project that will manipulate a string of your choice.

The main class will do the following:
```
1. Collect the string from the user.
2. Pass the input to the worker class.
3. Display all the outputs that the worker class generates.
```

The worker class will have the following methods:
```
1. A constructor Method: it will instantiate all the global variables used.
2. A passInfo method: it will collect the data passed from the main class. 
3. A countVowels method: This method will count all the vowels inside the string,  the letter 'y' will not be consider a vowel.
4. A reverse method: This method will display the input backwards. If you use the prebuilt method for this, you will fail the project.  You must use a loop!
5. A checkPalindrome method: this method will determine if your string is or is not a palindrome. 
6. A toString method: The toString method will pass the results from countvowels, reverse, and checkPalindrome methods back to the main classs, inorder for the results to be printed.
```
